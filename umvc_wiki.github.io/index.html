				<p> Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is a crossover fighting game developed by Capcom in collaboration with Eighting. It is an updated version of Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds. The game, like others preceeding it, features characters from both Capcom's video game franchises and comic book series published by Marvel Comics. The game was released in November 2011 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and was featured as a launch title for the PlayStation Vita in 2012. The game was later ported to PlayStation 4 in December 2016, and Xbox One and Microsoft Windows in March 2017.</p>
			
				<p> In Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, players select a team of three characters to engage in fast paced combat and attempt to knock out their opponents. As an update, the game utilizes largely identical gameplay mechanics to the original. However, both the aerial combat and X-Factor systems, introduced in Fate of Two Worlds, have received adjustements. In addition to gameplay modifications and new playable characters, the game features several aethetic changes.</p>
				
				<p>After the events of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami disrupted the development schedule for downloadable content for Fate of Two Worlds, the additional content was created into a standalone title, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, for a discounted retail price. The game received generally positive reviews upon release; critics praised the expanded character roster and improved online experience, but criticized the lack of new features and game modes. A sequel, titled Marvel vs. Capcom: infinite, was released in September 2017.</p>

		<h1>Modes</h1>
		
		<p>Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 includes several game modes from the original, including Arcade Mode, where the player fights against AI-controlled opponents to reach the final boss character, Galactus; Versus Mode, where two players fight it out; Mission Mode, which includes a series of trials for each playable character; and Training Mode. "Heroes and Heralds" is a free downloadable single-player and multiplayer team-based mode where players earn new abilities with upgrade cards, customize their characters with new powers, and compete in factions as either heroes defending Earth or as one of Galactus' Heralds. The "ability cards", which feature various characters present in the Marvel and Capcom universes, unlock special power-ups, such as invisibility and projectile invincibility, for use during mode-specific combat. Up to three different cards can be equipped at once, with more than 100 cards available to collect. A new offline mode, called "Galactus Mode", allows the players to fight as Galactus against AI-controlled opponents.</p>
		
		<h1>Playable Characters</h1>
		
		<p>Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 still features the original 36 characters from Marvel vs Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds and introduces 12 new playable fighters. The six new Marvel characters include Doctor Strange, Ghost Rider, Hawkeye, Iron Fist, Nova, and Rocket Raccoon. The six new Capcom characters consist of Firebrand from Ghosts'n Goblins, Frank West from Dead Rising, Nemesis T-Type from Resident Evil, Phoenix Wright from Ace Attorney, Strider Hiryu from Strider, and Vergil from Devil May Cry. Jill Valentine and Shuma-Gorath, the two characters released as downloadable content(DLC) for the previous game, remained available for download, up until all DLC content for the game was removed from online stores in December 2013; however, they are included with the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC re-releases.</p>
